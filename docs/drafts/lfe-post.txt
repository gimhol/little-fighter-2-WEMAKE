I've also made a remastered version of LF2. Everyone is welcome to give it a try.

Play-test address: https://lf.gim.ink/

Since the logic is implemented according to my own understanding(and some tutorial for modifying), 
many things are quite different from the original version. 

Only the data and pictures are processed and converted from the original.

- There are currently many issues:
- There are some problems with the AI.
[s]- Online multiplayer gaming has not been implemented yet.[/s]
- Only VS Mode and Stage Mode are supported, with hardly any other modes.

The only commendable thing is that this thing runs at 60 frames per second...

Although I kind of hope someone can join me in the development, 
considering that my personal development style is a bit erratic (I often make large-scale adjustments to some things), 
I think I'll pass for now. 

However, everyone is still welcome to run this project and give it a try.

======================================================================

I spent quite a bit of time resolving various issues regarding inconsistent calculation results.

Finally, the online multiplayer function has been added. If you're interested, you can give it a try (for testing purposes).

I haven't conducted a very thorough test, so I don't know if there will be any synchronization failures.

- Tested on Windows Chrome and Windows Firefox (sometimes the "connect" button doesn't respond in Firefox...).
- It can also be used on Android browsers, but there seem to be relatively significant performance issues.
- The server is on Alibaba Cloud (Guangzhou), and its performance is rather poor.

======================================================================

The server is based on nodejs. Through testing, it can also run on Bun and Deno.

If you want to run your own server, download "server.cjs" from the following link:

https://github.com/gimhol/little-fighter-2-WEMAKE/releases/tag/v0.1.0

Then run "node ./server.cjs".

Considering that the current data and logic are not stable, and to conduct some version management, 
the original address will be changed to a directory page, as shown in the figure below:

You need to click on the title to enter the game of the specified version.

v0.1.4 release:

fix: fix the problem that the background and level buttons do not respond,
fix: fix the problem of incorrect display on the scoreboard
fix: weapon will have a more reasonable effect
fix: Improved the performance of the weapon's bounce when it hits the ground.
fix: Fixed the problem of incorrect starting point for weapon throwing.
fix: Fixed the issue that airborne weapons can't be hit again.
feat: Rooms can now be password - protected.
fix: It's no longer possible to join a room that has already started or where all players are ready.
fix: The survival mode will correctly display the current stage number.
fix: The "GO->" will no longer be displayed in the survival mode.
fix: The "GO->" will no longer be displayed in the last sub-level of the mission-passing mode.
fix: Fixed the problem of incorrect relationship between difficulty and the number of enemies in the mission-passing/survival mode 
(the problem was that there were too many enemies).

Experiment: I've chosen a revised LF2 (RN-LF2) to test the data conversion. 
Currently, there are still many problems. Now you can see it on the index page.

Sometimes it’s tricky to tell whether a object is an ally or an enemy.
Especially when there are too many entities on the field, 
or when you spot a projectile flying toward you from afar. 

That’s why I’m trying to add a “team outline” effect to LF2: Wemake.（See figure below）

This feature will double the texture loading volume, which will result in slower loading speeds.

It will also double the number of rendered entities on the field, 
which may affect the game performance as well. 
However, it seems to run fine on my device for now.

v0.1.5 release:
