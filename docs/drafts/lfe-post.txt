I've also made a remastered version of LF2. Everyone is welcome to give it a try.

Play-test address: https://lf.gim.ink/

Since the logic is implemented according to my own understanding(and some tutorial for modifying), 
many things are quite different from the original version. 

Only the data and pictures are processed and converted from the original.

- There are currently many issues:
- There are some problems with the AI.
[s]- Online multiplayer gaming has not been implemented yet.[/s]
- Only VS Mode and Stage Mode are supported, with hardly any other modes.

The only commendable thing is that this thing runs at 60 frames per second...

Although I kind of hope someone can join me in the development, 
considering that my personal development style is a bit erratic (I often make large-scale adjustments to some things), 
I think I'll pass for now. 

However, everyone is still welcome to run this project and give it a try.

======================================================================

I spent quite a bit of time resolving various issues regarding inconsistent calculation results.

Finally, the online multiplayer function has been added. If you're interested, you can give it a try (for testing purposes).

I haven't conducted a very thorough test, so I don't know if there will be any synchronization failures.

- Tested on Windows Chrome and Windows Firefox (sometimes the "connect" button doesn't respond in Firefox...).
- It can also be used on Android browsers, but there seem to be relatively significant performance issues.
- The server is on Alibaba Cloud (Guangzhou), and its performance is rather poor.

======================================================================

The server is based on nodejs. Through testing, it can also run on Bun and Deno.

If you want to run your own server, download "server.cjs" from the following link:

https://github.com/gimhol/little-fighter-2-WEMAKE/releases/tag/v0.1.0

Then run "node ./server.cjs".

============================= 2025-01-15 ==============================

Considering that the current data and logic are not stable, and to conduct some version management, 
the original address will be changed to a directory page, as shown in the figure below:
