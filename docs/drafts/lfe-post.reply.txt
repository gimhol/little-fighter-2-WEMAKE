My mistake. My game page uses HTTPS, 
and in this case, the server must also be configured with an SSL certificate.

================================================================================

Modern browsers prohibit initiating insecure WebSocket connections(i.e., using the ws:// protocol) from HTTPS pages. 
This is because insecure WebSocket connections may expose sensitive information, 
thereby threatening the security of users' data. Therefore, 
you must use the secure WebSocket protocol (i.e., wss://) to ensure the security of the connection.

Some browsers may offer options to bypass this rule (though I don’t recommend doing so).

I found a blog that provides these methods, but I haven’t verified whether they are feasible.

Note: For security reasons, remember to revert this setting after use!

================================================================================

If your server supports HTTPS access, you can refer to the link below to configure the certificate.

"Multiplayer Online Game"

By the way, You can perform the following checks:
- Whether port is occupied by other programs
- Whether port is blocked by the firewall

================================================================================

If your server does not support HTTPS access，you cannot directly connect via my game page...

In addition, I will figure out another way to make the server work without SSL certificates, 
It is not certain whether this is feasible...

================================================================================

Later, I might wrap this web page with client-side frameworks to solve this problem.

Or, You can deploy this web page on your own server. 
I will try my best to package it for each release. 
You can check it at the address below.
